## 📊 Cloud Computing & Data Technician Project

### 📌 Project Overview

This repository documents my hands-on learning and practical work as part of a **Data Technician – Cloud Computing** programme. The project focuses on **cloud fundamentals, Microsoft Azure services, and SQL-based data analysis**, demonstrating how cloud platforms are used to store, manage, secure, and analyse data in real-world business scenarios.

Throughout this workbook and supporting labs, I applied both **theoretical knowledge and practical implementation**, with a strong emphasis on **Azure cloud infrastructure** and **relational databases using SQL**.

### ☁️ Azure Cloud Technologies Used

* **Microsoft Azure** for cloud infrastructure and data services
* Understanding and application of **IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS** service models
* Azure **Pricing Calculator** to estimate real-world cloud costs
* Exploration of **Azure architecture and core services**
* Hands-on labs using:

  * **Azure SQL Database**
  * **Relational and non-relational data services**
  * Cloud-based data storage concepts and formats

This project demonstrates how Azure enables **scalable, cost-effective, and secure cloud solutions** compared to traditional on-premises systems.
